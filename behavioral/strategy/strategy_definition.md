Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms,
put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific
in a lot of different ways and extract all of these algorithms into separate classes
called strategies.

The original class, called context, must have a field for storing a reference to one
of the strategies. The context delegates the work to a linked strategy object instead
of executing it on its own.
